Display Router Info
What command displays the statistics for all interfaces configured on the router: 'sh interfaces'
What command displays the information about Serial 0/0/0 int: 'sh int S0/0/0'
Enter the command to display the statistics for Serial 0/0/0 and answer the following: 'sh int s0/0/0'
    What IP address is configured on R1?: Will be found on the line that says 'Internet Address is X'
    What is the bandwidth on the Serial 0/0/0 int?: Will be found on the line that says 'MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1544 Kbit, DLY 20000 usec', 'BW 1544 Kbit' is the bandwidth for this link.
Enter the command to display the statistics for GigEthernet 0/0 and answer the following: 'sh int g0/0'
    What is the IP address?: Will be found on the line that says 'Internet Address is X'
    What is the MAC address of GigEthernet0/0?: Will be found on the line that states Hardware is X GigEthernet, address is Y (bia Z)' where 'Y' is the MAC address of the device connected to that interface.
        BIA is 'burned in address' this will NEVER change, however MAC address's can be changed on the device.
    What is the bandwidth of GigEthernet0/0?: Will be found on the line that says 'MTU X bytes, BW Y, DLY Z usec', 'BW Y' is the bandwidth for this link.

Display A Summary List Of The Interfaces On R1
Which command displays a brief summary of the current interfaces, int status and IP address assigned to them?: 'sh ip int brief'
How many serial interfaces are are there?: 'sh int | include Serial'
How many etehrnet interfaces are there?: 'sh int | include Eth'
Are all the ethernet interfaces on R1 the same?: No, as Ethernet is 10Mbps, FastEth is 100Mbps and GigEth is 1Gbps or 1000Mbps

Display Routing Table On R1
What command displays the contents of the routing table?: 'sh ip route'
How many connected routers are there (C)?: There is a Codes table above the actual routes that can help clarify what router are what. Connected routers use the code C.
Which route is listed?: The only Connected route is Serial0/0/0 as it is the only interfaces that has been configured with an IP. If there is a connected router then there will also be a Local (L) route. Local routes are for just that IP and have a subnet of /32 or 255.255.255.255.
How does a router handle a packet destined for a network that is not listed in the routing table?: As there is no way for the router to route that packet it will drop it.

Configure Router Interfaces
Configure G0/0 int on R1: 'int g0/0', 'ip add 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0', 'no shut'.
Configure description on int: 'desc LAN connection to S1', 'end'.

Ping PC1
On router: 'ping 192.168.10.10'

Configure remaining interfaces on R1 and R2
R1:
    g0/1: 'int g0/1', 'ip add 192.168.11.1 255.255.255.0', 'desc LAN connection to S2'.
R2:
    g0/0: 'int g0/0', 'ip add 10.1.1.10 255.255.255.0', 'desc LAN connection to S3'.
    g0/1: 'int g0/1', 'ip add 10.1.2.10 255.255.255.0', 'desc LAN connection to S4'.

Back up
Backup R1 and R2: 'copy run start'

Verify The Config
Check IPs of ints: 'sh ip int br'
How many interfaces on R1 and R2 are configured
What part of the config is not in this command?: Subnet Mask
What command can you use to verify subnet mask?: 'sh int'
