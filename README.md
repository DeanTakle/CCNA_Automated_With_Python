In the repo I will be going through a vast amount of labs manually and then will be automating them using Python and later on using Ansible.

There will be some labs that cannot be done via the means of automation, as to automate you will need to have and IP address and SSH (Port 22) setup before being able to connect to a device remotley. You can connect to a device via Telnet (Port 23), however SSH is the industry standard due to it being secure by encrypti g data in transit unlike Telnet that has zero encryption.

Everything added to this repository will be added via Git.

I will be using a vast amount of labs stemming from my Uni Course, Niel Anderson and Jeremy's IT Lab
