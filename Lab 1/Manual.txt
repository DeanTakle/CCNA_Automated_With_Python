Part 1) Verify Deafult Switch Config

Step 1.1) Enter Priv Exec mode
- So for this section where it asks for us to enter 'Priv Exec' mode, all you need to do once logged into the devie is to run the 'en' from 'User Exec' mode.
- You can verify what mode you are in by looking at the section before entering the commands.
    - User Exec = 'DeviceName>' - Intial exec mode when logging in, can only see a certain amount of commands.
    - Priv Exec = 'DeviceName#' - Enter this exec mode by using the 'en' command in 'User Exec' mode, can use and see all configuration of the device.
    - Global Config = 'DeviceName(config)' - Enter this mode by using the 'conf t' command in 'Priv Exec' mode, has unresricted access to the device, can see and configure the device.

Step 1.2) Examine current switch config
- So to see the current config on a switch you will need to run the 'sh start' command from within 'Prive Exec' mode.
    - This command will show all the current config that has been saved to the device as will be used whenever the device boots up.
    - Within 'Global Config' mode you cannot use 'sh' commands, so to get around this all you have to do is add 'do' infront of any 'sh' commands you want to use
        - 'do sh start' allows for the user to see the startup config in the 'Global Config' mode.
- When using 'sh' commands you can specifcy sections or what line to include making it easier to find what you are looking for.
    - Be careful when using '| {sec | inc}' commands due to some 'sh' commands being case sensitive.
    - 'sh start | sec int' - shows all lines within the config that is part of an interface.
    - 'sh start | inc int' - shows all lines within the config that has 'int' in it.

Step 1.2.a) How many Fast Eth interfaces are there?
- use the 'sh start | inc Fast' to show all interfaces that have 'Fast' in them.


Step 1.2.b) How many Gigabit Eth interfaces are there?
- use the 'sh start | inc Gig' to show all interfaces that have 'Gig' in them.

Step 1.2.c) What is the range of values shown for the vty lines?
- use the 'sh start | inc vty' to show all interfaces that have 'vty' in them.

Step 1.2.d) Which command will display the current contents of non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM)?
- We have already used the 'sh' command to display NVRAM contents - 'sh start'
    - 'sh start' = NVRAM - shows config that will remain on the device even after being rebooted
    - 'sh run' = RAM - shows currenlty used config that when device is rebooted will be removed
    - 'sh flash' = Flash - shows IOS files saved to the device 

Step 1.2.e) Why does the switch respond 'startup-config is not present'?
- when running 'sh start' the repsonse 'startup-config is not present' because there is not startup-config on the device.

Part 2) Create a Basic Switch Config

Step 2.1) Assign a name to a switch
- To assign a name to a switch the command 'hostname' is used followed by the name you would like to allocate to the device itself, whilst being in 'Global Config' mode.
- To enter 'Global Config' mode we will need to use the command 'conf t' from the 'Priv Exec' mode.
    - Global Config mode allows for you to globally configure the device and is the only mode that allows for configuration of a device.
- Once in Global Config mode, enter the command 'hostname {DeviceName}' and hit enter. Whatever you decided to put for {DeviceName} will be its hostname.
    - You 'can verify this using two methods:
        - 'sh run | inc hostname' or by looking at what is before the exec mode indcator ({DeviceName}(config))

Step 2.2) Secure access to the console line
- Securing acccess to the console is a must, if you do not do this then anybody can connect a console cable to the device and have full access to do whatever they want.
- To secure access to the console you must be in global config mode - enter this by using the 'conf t' command in priv exec.
- Once in global config mode you will run the 'line console 0' command - this will put you into the console interface configuration mode.
- From here you will run commands that are specific to the console interface only.
    - Add a password to the console interface - enter 'password {Password}'.
    - Force the console interface to use password stored on the local database stored on the device itself - 'login local'
    - Exit the console interface using the 'exit' command.
        - The 'exit' command takes you back to the mode below the one you are in. Using the exit command in Global Config mode takes you back to Priv Exec mode as this is the mode below.
        - The 'end' comamnd takes you out of Global Config mode completley no matter what mode you are in.

Step 2.2.a) Why is the login command required?
- As stated earlier the 'login' command is requried as it forces the console interface to use password stored on the local database which is on the device itself.

Step 2.3) Verify that console access is secured
- To do this just use the exit command till you get to the start screen. From here press enter and it will ask for a password. Enter the password that you configured on the device.
- If you are not prompted for a password then you may have missed the 'login' command on the console interface in Step 2.

Step 2.4) Secure Priv Exec mode access
- Securing access to Priv Exec mode allows for extra security in case anyone tries to connect to the device via any mean that is not console. Like Telnet or SSH.
- To secure Priv Exec mode, go into Global Config using 'conf t'.
- Once in Global Config use the 'enable password {password}'.
- Press 'exit' to leave global config mode.

Step 2.5) Verify priv mode access is secure
- use 'exit command to log out the switch.
- log back into the switch using the password you conifgured for the console interface.
- use 'en' config to enter priv mode.
- you should be met with a password prompt, if so then enter the password you entered in step 4.
    - if you entered the correct password then you should now be in priv exec mode.
- use 'sh run' to verify the password you configured on the switch as 'enable password {password}' command is not encrypted so you can see the password in plain text.

Step 2.6) Configure an encrypted password to secure access to priv mode
- Same steps as Step 4 but instead of 'enable password {password}' we want to do 'enable secret {password}'
    - The unecncrypted password will be overided by the encrypted password if both have be configured, so you will need to enter the encrypted password to get access to the device.

Step 2.7) Verify that the encrypted passwoed is added to configuration
- Same as Step 5 however you will see a bunch on letters and numbers instead of the actual password meaning it has been hashed.
- The hashing is only MD5 so it is not the most secure, however it is much more secure then plain text.

Step 2.8) Encrypt the enable and console passwords
- As some passwords are not always encrypted, like the console password and the enable password password, you can use a global command that will encrpyt all plain text password mith MD7 encryption which is worse then MD5.
- To do this use the 'service password-encryption' command in global mode.
- Use the 'do sh run' to see if all password are encrpyted

Part 3) Configure a MOTD Banner

Step 3.1) Configure a message of the day (MOTD) banner.
- Make sure to be in the global config mode then enter the following 'banner motd "{MESSAGE}"', where {MESSAGE} is your message.
- This will create a message that will be seen when people attmpt to login to the device.
- To verify this look at the running config and you should see it above the VTY config.

Step 3.1.a) When will this banner be displayed?
- When someone attempts to login onto the device.

Step 3.1.b) Why should every switch have a MOTD banner?
- It is used a a warning to unauthorised users. Potentially acts as a deterant.

Part 4) Save and Verify Config Files to NVRAM.

Step 4.1) Verify config is correct and save it to NVRAM.
- Use 'sh run' command to make sure everything is correct with the config.
- Once checked use the 'copy run start' command to merge the running config with the startup config so if the switch does get rebooted it will have the correct config.

Step 4.1.a) What is the shortest abbreviation of 'copy running-config startup-config'.
- copy run start.

Step 4.1.b) Examine the startup config file.
- sh start.

Step 4.1.c) Which command will display the contents of NVRAM'.
- sh start.

Part 5) Configure S2.
- Follow the steps above until its the same as S1.
- Hostname = S2 - 'hostname S2.
- Protect console access using 'letmein' as password - 'line console 0', 'password letmein', 'login', 'exit'.
- Configure enable password of 'c1$c0' and enable secret password of 'itsasecret' - 'enable password c1$c0', 'enable secret itsasecret'.
- Configure banner motd - 'banner motd "AUTHORISED USERS ONLY!"'.
- Encrypt all plain text password - 'service password-encryption'.
- Ensure config is correct - 'sh run'
- Save config - 'copy run start'
